1. Two balls are launched simultaneously from a height of 10 meters.  One of them (Ball A) is shot horizontally away from the starting point, while the second (Ball B) drops straight down.

   a. Ball A hits the ground first
   b. Ball B hits the ground first
   c. Ball A and B hit the ground at the same time

Explain your reasoning for whichever answer you choose. 

2. You push a 12 kilogram lawnmower with a force of 50 N, directed along the handle, which makes an angles of 40 degrees with the ground.

   a. Find the horizontal and vertical components of the force.
   b. How much work is done in pushing the mower 30 meters?
   c. By how much does the momentum of the lawn mower change if you push for 5 seconds? (assuming no friction)
   d. If the coefficient of friction between the mower and the ground is $\\mu = 0.3$, how large is the force of friction?
