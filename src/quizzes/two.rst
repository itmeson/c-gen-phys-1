1. What is your average speed if:

   a. you travel at 20 meters per second for 2 minutes, and at 15 meters per second for 2 minutes?
   b. you travel at 20 meters per second for 2 minutes, and at 15 meters per second for 5 minutes?

2. Suppose that the equation $x(t) = 5t^2 + 6t + 2$ represents the position of an object in meters.

   a. Make a careful graph of this motion on graph paper.
   b. Compute the position of the object at $t=0$, $t=1$, and $t=10$ seconds.
   c. Compute the average speed between $t=1$ and $t=10$
   d. Compute the instantaneous speed at $t=1$ second.

3. You should get different results for parts (c) and (d) above.  Why?  What is the difference between an average speed and an instantaneous speed?
