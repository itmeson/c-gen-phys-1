1. In the crash of a fighter jet, an object travelling approximately 700 miles
per hour (~350 meters per second) is brought to rest in about 1.5 seconds.
What acceleration is required to stop the jet's motion ?  What could you
compare this number to to get a sense of the size of this acceleration?  Could the pilot survive?

2. Suppose the following function represents the displacement of an object:
      $x(t) = 3t^2 + 2t + 10 $

   a. Graph the function carefully on graph paper.
   b. Compute the position of the object at $ t = 2 $ seconds.
   c. Find the average speed of the object between $t = 1$ and $t=2.5$ seconds.
   d. Find a way to compute the *instantaneous* speed at $t=2$ seconds.
