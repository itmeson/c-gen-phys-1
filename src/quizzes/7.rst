1. A small spacecraft has an engine that can give it a constant acceleration of $1 m/s^2$.  

   a. How far will it travel in one hour?
   b. What is the average speed of the craft over that hour?
   c. How far will the craft travel in the second hour of its flight? 
   d. If the mass of the craft is $ 2 kg $, what force is the engine exerting? Is this force feasible for a small craft?

2. Suppose that a cart is attached to a string running through a pulley, with a mass of 100 grams attached to the string.  You measure an acceleration of $ 5 m/s^2$ for the cart.  Even if you cannot answer this question fully, partial credit will be given for your reasoning -- so show all your work!

   a.  Assuming zero friction, what is the mass of the cart?
   b.  If there were a coefficient of kinetic friction of $\\mu=0.2$, what must the mass of the cart be?
