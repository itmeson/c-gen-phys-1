1.  Two people push on opposite ends of a box (opposing each other).  Person 1
exerts a force of $100 N$, while person 2 exerts a force of $70 N$.  

    a. Draw free body diagrams for the person 1, person 2, and the box, assuming that there is no friction.  
    b. Make up numbers for any masses that you need (write them down clearly), and then calculate and explain what will happen.  
    c. After 1 minute of whatever happened in b, where will Person 1, Person 2, and the box be?  Give positions relative to the starting location, in meters.

2.  How fast would a tennis ball have to be travelling to have the same momentum as a tractor trailer on the highway?  Make estimates (and clearly write them  down) for any masses or speeds you need.
