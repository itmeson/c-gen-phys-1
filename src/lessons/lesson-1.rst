Introduction

What is physics?


The big questions of physics are the big questions of the universe:
what is it?  Why is it there?  Did it have to be this way, or could it
have been different?  Physics uses mathematics, experiment, and
explanation to come to terms with things that are almost unimaginable
in scale.  The Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland is smashing
particles called protons into each other at speeds very, very close to
the speed of light, and watching very closely to see all the debris
that come out of the collisions.  They are a little bit different
every time, due, apparently, to some randomness in the ether.


What do they do, when they track these debris?  They trace backward,
finding that the debris they see at the detectors (which, obviously,
can't be quite at the location of the collisions), have moved in
straight lines outward from previous collisions -- that themselves
traced backward into the singular moment of the original collision.
They calculate the momenta of these particles, and make calculations
about what kinds of interactions could have caused those particular
particles, with those particular momenta and directions to have been
produced. And every once in a while, they find that they cannot
explain the traces they see using any of the known particles, or any
of the known ways that those particles can interact with each other.
And if they see one of those strange events enough times (so they are
sure it wasn't a fluke of a mishap with the detectors), and they can
find someone who can suggest an explanation, they propose: "HEY!!
We've found a BRAND NEW particle!! No one has EVER seen this before.
We are BAD-ASS!!"


The stakes are very high.  Billions of dollars.  The careers of
thousands of scientists and engineers.  But at heart, what they are
doing, is not so different from a traffic engineer -- surveying the
scene of an accident, photographing the final locations of the
vehicles, the specific damage done to the bodies, the tracks on the
pavement, to determine who was speeding or which vehicle crossed the
center-line.  Except that sometimes the answer is: "A Higgs particle
suddenly came into existence and pushed Car number 2 into the path of Car
number 1."


Physics I teaches you the basic principles, techniques, and thought
processes necessary to understand a crash scene or a particle trace
from the LHC.  Along the way, you learn how to analyze building
components for stability, the claims of "green" energy purveyors,
and the motions of spinning things.  You'll also practice developing
explanatory models for different phenomena, and testing those models
using experiments you will design yourself.  


Many people dislike science and math because it makes them feel
stupid.  Because scientists are unusually good at saying "You're
wrong!"


If you learn nothing else in this class, I want you to learn this:
Being Wrong is Good.  You cannot improve unless you hit the wall of
your current limitations.  Being wrong is a sign that you've hit one
of those walls, and is therefore a signal about where you need to
work.  The goal is of course to become not-wrong, but you cannot get
there without going through some wrongness.  My job is to help you
find those limits without hurting you, so you can push them back.


I believe that this is true of everything worth doing, but it is
particularly clear in math and science, where the whole process works
by proposing models and testing them.  A model cannot be a good model
if there is no way that you could discover it is false.  People have
an unfortunate tendency to seek out evidence that supports their
current belief, missing the evidence that contradicts it.  You are
much more likely to avoid being misled by forming a
prediction/model/explanation/etc. that you think is good, then writing
down what kinds of evidence would show that you are WRONG, and then to go
looking for that CONTRADICTORY evidence.


Alright -- so enough of that.  Now I'm going to give you a test!  Yes,
a test.  The point of this test is to help me ensure that I'm actually
teaching you something.  I'm setting up an experiment, and my
hypothesis is that you are going to learn a lot of mechanics this
term.  That's what I want to have happen.  So I've identified a lot of
things that would count as evidence that you have NOT learned any
mechanics, and I will test you on them repeatedly through the term.
Your grade will depend on convincing me, over and over again, that you
have learned specific concepts and skills in mechanics.  The more
things you try to convince me about, the higher your grade can
potentially get.  


But for my tests to work, I have to have some information about where
you're at right now.  Because one possible way that I could be misled
is if you happen to ALREADY know a lot of mechanics.  So this test is
designed to help me find that out.  It's multiple choice, it's hard,
and you should do your absolute best on it -- think about the
questions, they are designed to be tricky.  When you are finished,
bring it up to me, and I have an assignment for you to work on for
next time, that you should get started on.

==========
The Course
==========

The class is not going to be easy.  I'm not saying that to frighten you, I only
want to be as honest as possible.  It will require work.  A university course
expects that you should spend 1-2 hours outside of class for every hour in
class -- which corresponds to 4-8 hours for the lecture portion of the class,
and another 3-6 hours for the lab.  That's just how much time it takes to
process and learn so you can expand your skills and knowledge.  So I'm giving
assignments that will take up a chunk of that time, and expecting that you will
fill in time as needed to keep up.  I know that many of you have jobs and other
expectations, and I respect that, but I still expect some comittment from you
to get the most possible out of this class.  I promise that I will never waste
your time, or give you work just to fill in the time -- it will always be
carefully planned to help you get as much as possible out of your investment.

The grading for the class will be different from what you've probably seen
before. The lion's share of your grade will come from a long list of skills and
concepts that I've identified as being particularly important.  You can find
the list on the syllabus, on ulearn, and on the course blog at
markbetnel.com/genphys.  You should read that list frequently.  I will give you
quizzes, tests, and assignments that are designed to test those skills, and
give you scores on a 1-4 scale that reflect your level of proficiency in each
one.  If you get 4's on 90% of the skills, you will get an A for the standards
mastery portion of the course.  If you get 4's on 80% of the skills, you will
get a B.  If you ever get lower than a 4 on a skill, you are *expected* to make
an effort to improve your performance on it.  Once you convince me that you are
going to do better on a new attempt at that skill, I will give you a new chance
to prove it.  Your scores in the gradebook will reflect your highest level of performance on each skill (so there is no cost to trying multiple times).

You should also try to identify skills that I have not mentioned -- if you can
convince me that there is an important skill that is not on the list, I will
create an assessment for that skill and give you a chance to prove your mastery
of that as well.  So there is an opportunity to take control of what you will
learn and master in the course, and an incentive to reflect on what you have
learned and on your grades. 

The rest of your grade will come from expected sources -- quiz scores on your first attempt, the final exam, homework, attendance and participation, etc.
