Intro Quiz
==========

1. Pass back and discuss results of introductory diagnostic. 
2. Demonstrate activegrade for tracking of standards mastery.
3. Discuss plan of attack for addressing the prior knowledge evidence 
   from the diagnostic.

Kinematics
==========

1. Building intuition about rates

   a. Measure speed of various motions  (elevator, going up and down
      stairs, walking across room, dropping something, videos...)
   b. Define and explain the necessary info/measurements: time, distance 
      (rationalize the previous work) 
   c. Create some video showing constant speed, and use video to measure
      the speed. What needs to be in the video to be able to determine the
      speed accurately?
   d. How to deal with situations in which the speed is not constant?

2. How do we predict how far something will travel, given its speed?

5. Formalize work with kinematic equations:

   a. $ x = v_0 t $
   b. $ v = v_0 + at $
   c. $ x = v_0 t + \\frac{1}{2} at^2$

6. It is important to understand
   *what*, *why*, and also to be able to work *efficiently*.  The equations
   seem abstract, but they enable efficiency by cutting away unnecessary 
   details.
