COURSE DESCRIPTION  
===================
SCI1011 is the first of a two part introductory Physics course sequence using algebra-based approaches to analyze physics phenomena. It introduces students to vector algebra and the basic principles of classical mechanics, applying the concepts of work, energy, linear momentum, and angular momentum to physical phenomena.  SCI1011 must be taken concurrently with the laboratory section (see SCI1---, Physics I Laboratory).

COURSE OBJECTIVES
==================
Based on materials presented in class and on readings, and assigned audiovisual materials, students will be able to:
 1. Apply different measurement systems to analyze problems of dimension consistency and perform unit analyses.
 2. Explain Newton’s Laws of Motion and apply them to the analysis of problems involving uniformly accelerated linear motion and circular motion.
 3. Use vector analysis (addition and subtraction) and algebra based analytical techniques to solve vector and scalar problems involving displacement, velocity, acceleration, and forces.
 4. Calculate the work performed and relate this to the energy of the system when given a system of forces applied to an object,.
 5. Distinguish between the major types of energy and evaluate how these forms manifest themselves.
 6. Examine how conservation of energy, work, and momentum relate to mass and force and characterize how they vary with time.  
 7. Students will synthesize main ideas to construct new concepts by
   a. Recognizing interrelationships among concepts and combining them into potentially useful primary statements with supportive evidence.
   b. Extending initial synthesis, when possible, at a higher level of abstraction to construct new hypotheses that may require additional information.
 8. Students will recognize the use of deductive reasoning to examine and test scientific   hypotheses.

EVALUATIVE CRITERIA:	
1. Final grades will be based on at least four graded items one of which will be an examination administered at the official scheduled final exam time.
2. A portion of the class grade may be assigned on the basis of class participation and timeliness of performance.
3. A fraction of the grade will be based upon completion of homework problem solving exercises selected by the instructor.
4. A percentage of the class grade will be based on written student centered activities focused on investigating particular Physics principles in more depth.

Weighted percentages of these criteria will be determined by the professor at the beginning of class.

LABORATORY:  Students must be concurrently registered in SCI1011L, SCI1011 PHYSICS LAB (w/ Algebra) (see separate Course Outline)
